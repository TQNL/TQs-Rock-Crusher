Make sure to get the resource pack located in the file if below 1.19.4.

# Tutorial

To start off, you need to craft a few things:

Get a Resourse Manual with this command: /trigger get_rock_crusher_manual

Look at the recipes for components of the rock crusher in the gallery
Finally, to craft the Rock Crusher, you need to get a fabricator by throwing your Recourse Manual onto the crafting table. Breaking the fabricator yields your Manuel and crafting table. In the fabricator:

Now that you have your Rock Crusher (looks like an item frame in newer versions), place it against a wall. I also recommend place hoppers above and below it, for automation. This data pack has custom hopper support. You do need to feed the hopper below into a chest, otherwise the items get lost. 


## Recipes:

You can crush granite into sand, which takes three minutes.

You can crush cobblestone and cobbled deepslate into gravel, which takes one minute and 75 seconds respectively.

Furthermore, you can craft a Quick Sand Bucket (doesnâ€™t have functionality, looks like powdered snow) (see gallery)

With the ferric Quick Sand Bucket, you can crush it into Red Sand, which takes 3 minutes



## Lore:

- Logic would dictate that you can crush stone or gravel into sand, but minecraft stone is (most likely) too poor in silica to make suitable sand, so we use silica rich, but tough granite.  This hypothetically too poor in silica based on a theory of mine.

- The rock crusher is a redstone machine that crushes rocks into smaller particles.

- Red sand is red because of rust. The quicksand you can craft has all the ingredients for the red sand. The mixture is crushed up and heated by the blaze powder to speed up the rusting.

- This data pack serves as an alternative to falling block dupers.
